# Custom Drawer Flutter Project

## Overview
This Flutter project demonstrates two custom drawer implementations with unique interaction patterns: Flippable Drawer and Scalable Drawer.

## Features

### 1. Flippable Drawer
- Drawer slides and rotates with a 3D flip effect
- Triggered by tap or horizontal drag gestures
- Smooth animation using `AnimationController`
- Implemented in `lib/flip_drawer.dart`

### 2. Scalable Drawer
- Drawer scales and slides from the side of the screen
- Occupies 60% of the screen width
- Triggered by menu icon or horizontal drag gestures
- Implemented in `lib/scalable_drawer.dart`
